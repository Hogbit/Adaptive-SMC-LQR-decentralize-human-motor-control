# Adaptive-SMC-LQR-decentralize-human-motor-control
This is a MATLAB Simulink file that simulate adaptive sliding mode and Linear qudratic regulator decentralize control.<br>
SMC_LQR_decentralize.m and SMC_PID_decentralize.m can run the simulnk mode and draw the correspond fig and gif.
    ARE_diag and Matrix balance is a Continuous Riccatti Equation solver for simulink mode.
    Other m file is used to calculate the linear mode of the inveted pendulum system.
